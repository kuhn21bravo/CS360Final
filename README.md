# CS360Final
WeightTrackingApp


This app is to fulfill the requirements of CS360 7-2. It can be pulled and launched in Android Studio.

The requirements of the application were to create a useful weight tracking interface that the user could easily login/signup. Give permission for SMS notifications and enter their current weights and goals weights to view them on a grid to view progress or degress.

It was necessary to implement several screens/buttons to make this functional and user centered. I kept users in mind by making this application easy to use and follow. I feel they were successful because I tested them on my wife and she was able to figure this out.

To approach the process of coding this app, I read a lot of tutorials and watched tutorials as well. After gaining a base understanding of how the formatting of the app needed to be coded, I was able to build this application one step at a time, building on each tool as I learned more.

In order to make sure my code was functional, I ran this in the Android emulator. It is important, because although the application was running successfully, you can test it on different platforms and screen sizes. 

It was necessary to innovate and overcome when it came to the layout of the application. I am a very impatient person, and do not like to build layouts. I enjoy working on the back end code.

The most stressful part of building this application was demonstrating my skills to build a user friendly layout.
